Boehm GC interface library for gcc-Ada (GNAT)
=============================================

What's this?
------------

Ada binding to the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector.

Prerequisites
-------------

GCC >= 4.7
 https://gcc.gnu.org/
Boehm GC >= 6.8
 http://www.hboehm.info/gc/
headmaster
 http://github.com/ytomino/headmaster

Usage
-----

1. Prepare the translated headers.

   A. Translate the C headers with headmaster. ::

       $ headmaster --to ada -p -D import-dir boehmgc-ada/source/import.h
      
      However, it may not work well in your environment.
      The plan B is recommended.

   B. Download them from `pre-translated headers page`_.

2. Add the source directories of boehmgc-ada and the translated headers
   to search path for gnatmake. ::

    $ gnatmake -Iboehmgc-ada/source -Iimport-dir your_main.adb
   
   Or please write .gpr file for your environment.

Build examples
--------------

1. Link the translated headers to `examples/import`. ::

    $ mkdir -p examples/import/$(gcc -dumpmachine)
    $ ln -s import-dir examples/import/$(gcc -dumpmachine)
   
   If this step is omitted, headmaster will be used.

2. Build them. ::

    $ make -C examples

Limitations
-----------

Multithreading is unsupported.
