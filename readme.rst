Boehm GC interface library for gcc-Ada (GNAT)
=============================================

What's this?
------------

Ada binding to the Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector.

Prerequisites
-------------

GCC >= 6
 https://gcc.gnu.org/
Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector >= 7.2
 https://www.hboehm.info/gc/
headmaster
 https://github.com/ytomino/headmaster

Usage
-----

1. Prepare the translated headers.

   A. Translate the C headers with headmaster. ::

       $ headmaster --to ada -p -D import-dir boehmgc-ada/source/import.h
      
      However, it may not work well in your environment.
      The plan B is recommended.

   B. Download them from `pre-translated headers page`_.

2. Add the source directories of boehmgc-ada and the translated headers
   to search path for gnatmake. ::

    $ gnatmake -Iboehmgc-ada/source -Iimport-dir your_main.adb
   
   Or please write .gpr file for your environment.

Build examples
--------------

1. Link the translated headers to `examples/import`. ::

    $ mkdir boehmgc-ada/examples/import
    $ ln -s $PWD/import-dir boehmgc-ada/examples/import/$(gcc -dumpmachine)
   
   If this step is omitted, headmaster will be used.

2. Build them. ::

    $ make -C boehmgc-ada/examples

Limitations
-----------

Multithreading is unsupported.

 Several files (gc/gc_allocator.h, extra/msvc_dbg.c) come with slightly
 different licenses, though they are all similar in spirit (the exact
 licensing terms are given at the beginning of the corresponding source file).
 
 A few of the files needed to use the GNU-style build procedure come with
 a modified GPL license that appears not to significantly restrict use of
 the collector, though use of those files for a purpose other than building
 the collector may require the resulting code to be covered by the GPL.
